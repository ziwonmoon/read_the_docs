# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Configuration and Environment Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create configuration management for the application to handle different environments and settings
# Details:
1. Create configuration file structure
2. Implement environment variable handling
3. Add configuration validation
4. Create default configurations
5. Implement configuration reloading
6. Add documentation for all configuration options
7. Create separate configurations for development and production

# Test Strategy:
1. Test configuration loading from different sources
2. Verify environment variable overrides
3. Test configuration validation
4. Validate default configurations
5. Test configuration reloading
6. Verify documentation accuracy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design configuration file structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a standardized file structure for configuration files that is organized and scalable
### Details:
Define the format (JSON, YAML, etc.), directory structure, naming conventions, and organization principles for configuration files. Consider separation of concerns and modularity in the design.

## 2. Implement environment variable handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a system to load and override configuration from environment variables
### Details:
Develop a mechanism to read environment variables and map them to configuration settings. Include support for prefixes, nested properties, and type conversion. Ensure security for sensitive values.

## 3. Build configuration validation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create validation rules and schema enforcement for configuration values
### Details:
Implement schema validation to ensure configuration values meet expected types, formats, and constraints. Include required fields checking, type validation, and range/format validation where appropriate.

## 4. Implement default configuration values [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3
### Description: Create a system for defining and applying default configuration values
### Details:
Develop a mechanism to define sensible defaults for all configuration options. Ensure defaults are documented and applied correctly when specific values are not provided.

## 5. Create configuration reloading mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Implement functionality to reload configuration at runtime without service restart
### Details:
Build a system that can detect configuration changes and reload them dynamically. Include proper error handling, validation during reload, and notification of changes to relevant system components.

## 6. Develop environment-specific configuration profiles [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create configuration profiles for different environments (dev, test, prod)
### Details:
Implement environment-specific configuration overrides that can be easily switched. Include mechanisms to detect the current environment and load the appropriate profile automatically.

## 7. Write configuration documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the configuration system
### Details:
Document all configuration options, their purpose, acceptable values, defaults, and examples. Include information on the overall architecture, validation rules, environment variable mapping, and best practices for configuration management.
