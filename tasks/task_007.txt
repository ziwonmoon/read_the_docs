# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Main Application Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the main application logic to handle the complete workflow from user query to response
# Details:
1. Create main application entry point
2. Implement message routing based on AI requests
3. Create workflow for document download requests
4. Implement document deletion workflow
5. Create document reading and query workflow
6. Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
7. Implement logging throughout the application
8. Create startup and shutdown procedures

# Test Strategy:
1. Test end-to-end workflow with various scenarios
2. Verify correct message routing
3. Test each workflow independently
4. Validate error handling and recovery
5. Test application startup and shutdown
6. Perform integration testing with AI system

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Application Entry Point [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the main entry point for the application that initializes all required components and services.
### Details:
Implement the main function or class that serves as the application's entry point. This should handle command-line arguments, environment configuration loading, and initialize the core application object. Include proper error handling for initialization failures.

## 2. Implement Message Routing System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a robust message routing system to direct requests to appropriate handlers based on operation type.
### Details:
Design and implement a router that can parse incoming requests, validate their structure, and route them to the correct workflow handler. Include support for different message types and versioning. Ensure the router can handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## 3. Develop Document Download Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement the complete workflow for document download operations from request to response.
### Details:
Create the workflow that handles document download requests, interacts with storage services, processes the document for delivery, and returns the appropriate response. Include retry logic, progress tracking, and proper error handling specific to download operations.

## 4. Implement Document Deletion Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create the workflow for securely deleting documents and associated metadata.
### Details:
Develop the deletion workflow that handles document removal requests, performs necessary validations, executes the deletion across all relevant storage systems, and ensures proper cleanup of associated metadata. Include confirmation mechanisms and audit logging of deletion operations.

## 5. Build Document Reading/Query Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement the workflow for document querying, searching, and reading operations.
### Details:
Create the workflow that processes document query and read requests, interacts with storage and indexing services, applies access controls, and formats results for the client. Include support for pagination, filtering, and sorting of results.

## 6. Develop Comprehensive Error Handling System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Create a centralized error handling system that manages errors across all workflows.
### Details:
Implement a robust error handling framework that can catch, categorize, and appropriately respond to errors from all parts of the application. Include support for different error severity levels, custom error types, and appropriate client-facing error messages that don't expose sensitive information.

## 7. Implement Application-wide Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.6
### Description: Create a comprehensive logging system that records application activities, errors, and performance metrics.
### Details:
Develop a logging framework that captures detailed information about application operations, errors, and performance. Include support for different log levels, structured logging, log rotation, and integration with external monitoring systems. Ensure sensitive information is properly redacted from logs.

## 8. Implement Startup and Shutdown Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.7
### Description: Create graceful startup and shutdown procedures for the application.
### Details:
Develop procedures for graceful application startup, including dependency checks, resource initialization, and readiness signaling. Implement shutdown procedures that properly release resources, complete in-flight operations, and save necessary state. Include handling for different shutdown scenarios (normal, emergency, etc.).
