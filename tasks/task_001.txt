# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Docker Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Docker environment for the MCP server with all necessary dependencies
# Details:
1. Create a Dockerfile with Python base image
2. Install required dependencies: MCP SDK, Playwright, LLAMAINDEX
3. Configure environment variables
4. Setup volume mounts for document storage
5. Configure network settings
6. Create docker-compose.yml for easy deployment
7. Include proper documentation for setup and usage

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Docker container builds successfully
2. Confirm all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Test container startup and shutdown
4. Validate volume mounts are working properly
5. Ensure network connectivity is functioning

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create a Dockerfile [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Dockerfile that defines the base image and basic configuration for the container
### Details:
Choose an appropriate base image (e.g., Ubuntu, Alpine, Node, Python), set working directory, and define basic environment setup. Include comments for clarity and maintainability.

## 2. Install dependencies in Dockerfile [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add commands to install all required dependencies and packages
### Details:
Use appropriate package managers (apt, yum, pip, npm) to install dependencies. Consider using multi-stage builds for smaller image size. Group related installations to leverage Docker caching.

## 3. Configure environment variables [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Define all necessary environment variables in the Docker configuration
### Details:
Use ENV directives in Dockerfile for build-time variables. Plan for runtime variables that will be passed via docker-compose or docker run commands. Consider using .env files for sensitive information.

## 4. Set up volume mounts [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Configure persistent storage through Docker volumes
### Details:
Identify directories that need persistence (data, logs, configuration). Define VOLUME directives in Dockerfile and plan corresponding host mounts in docker-compose.yml. Consider permissions and ownership of mounted volumes.

## 5. Configure network settings [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up port mappings and network configuration
### Details:
Expose necessary ports in Dockerfile using EXPOSE directive. Plan port mappings for docker-compose.yml. Consider network isolation, container communication, and security implications.

## 6. Create docker-compose.yml [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
### Description: Write a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the container setup
### Details:
Define services, networks, and volumes. Include environment variables, port mappings, volume mounts, and network configurations. Set restart policies, resource limits, and dependencies between services if needed.

## 7. Document the Docker setup [done]
### Dependencies: 1.6
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the Docker environment
### Details:
Document build and run instructions, environment variables, volume mounts, network configuration, and troubleshooting tips. Include examples of common commands and operations. Explain architecture decisions and potential customizations.
