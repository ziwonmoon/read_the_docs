# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Logging and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive logging and monitoring system for the application
# Details:
1. Setup logging framework
2. Implement different log levels
3. Create log rotation mechanism
4. Add performance monitoring metrics
5. Implement health check endpoints
6. Create error reporting mechanism
7. Add audit logging for security-sensitive operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify log output format and content
2. Test log rotation
3. Validate performance metrics collection
4. Test health check endpoints
5. Verify error reporting
6. Test audit logging for key operations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up logging framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select and implement a logging framework that supports structured logging and multiple output destinations
### Details:
Research and select an appropriate logging framework (e.g., Winston, Bunyan for Node.js; Log4j, Logback for Java). Configure the framework with basic settings. Set up integration with the application architecture. Ensure the framework supports JSON formatting for logs.

## 2. Implement log levels and categories [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Configure different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and categorize logs by module/component
### Details:
Define standard log levels for the application. Create logging categories based on application components. Implement context enrichment to include relevant metadata with each log entry. Configure environment-specific log level settings (development vs. production).

## 3. Set up log rotation and retention policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement log rotation based on size/time and define retention periods for different log types
### Details:
Configure log files to rotate based on size (e.g., 100MB) or time (e.g., daily). Set up compression for rotated logs. Define retention policies (e.g., keep error logs for 90 days, info logs for 30 days). Implement automated cleanup of expired logs.

## 4. Implement performance metrics collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Set up collection of key performance indicators like response times, throughput, and resource utilization
### Details:
Select a metrics collection library/framework. Instrument code to capture response times and latency. Set up monitoring for system resources (CPU, memory, disk, network). Implement custom metrics for business-specific KPIs. Configure sampling rates for high-volume metrics.

## 5. Create health check endpoints and alerts [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Implement health check API endpoints and set up alerting for system issues
### Details:
Create API endpoints for system health status. Implement deep health checks for dependencies (database, cache, external services). Set up alerting thresholds and notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty). Configure alert severity levels and escalation policies.

## 6. Set up error reporting and tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement centralized error collection, aggregation, and tracking system
### Details:
Set up error tracking service integration (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar). Implement global error handlers to capture uncaught exceptions. Configure error grouping and deduplication. Set up error notifications and assignment workflows. Implement context collection for errors (user info, request data).

## 7. Implement audit logging for security events [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Set up specialized logging for security-relevant events and user actions
### Details:
Define security-relevant events requiring audit logs (login attempts, permission changes, data access). Implement secure storage for audit logs with tamper protection. Ensure PII/sensitive data handling complies with regulations. Set up longer retention periods for audit logs. Create audit log review procedures and reports.
