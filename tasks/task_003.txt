# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Document Download Module with Playwright
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a module to download documents from web using Playwright for crawling
# Details:
1. Initialize Playwright browser instance
2. Implement URL validation
3. Create functions to detect document type (PDF/HTML)
4. Implement PDF download functionality
5. Implement HTML scraping and saving
6. Add support for handling authentication if needed
7. Implement robots.txt checking with optional override capability (hidden feature)
8. Create proper file naming and organization structure
9. Add error handling for network issues, invalid URLs, etc.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test URL validation with various inputs
2. Verify correct document type detection
3. Test PDF download functionality
4. Test HTML scraping and saving
5. Validate robots.txt compliance
6. Test error handling with invalid URLs and network issues

# Subtasks:
## 1. Browser Initialization Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a component to initialize and manage browser sessions for document downloads
### Details:
Implement a browser initialization module that can start headless browsers, manage sessions, handle cookies, and provide a clean interface for other components. Include configuration options for browser type (Chrome, Firefox), timeout settings, and proxy support.

## 2. URL Validation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop a system to validate and normalize URLs before attempting downloads
### Details:
Create a URL validation component that checks for properly formatted URLs, normalizes them (handling redirects, relative paths), validates domain existence, and provides feedback on validation failures. Include support for different protocols (http, https, ftp).

## 3. Document Type Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Implement logic to detect and classify document types from URLs and content
### Details:
Build a document type detection system that can identify document types (PDF, HTML, DOC, etc.) based on URL patterns, HTTP headers, and content inspection. Create a flexible classification system that can be extended for new document types.

## 4. PDF Download Handler [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Create specialized functionality for downloading and processing PDF documents
### Details:
Implement a PDF-specific download handler that can properly request PDF files, handle binary data, verify PDF integrity, extract metadata, and save files with appropriate naming conventions. Include support for password-protected PDFs.

## 5. HTML Scraping Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Develop an engine to scrape and process HTML content from web pages
### Details:
Build an HTML scraping component that can download HTML pages, handle JavaScript rendering when needed, extract relevant content, process embedded resources, and convert to standardized formats. Include support for different encoding types and HTML versions.

## 6. Authentication Handler [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Implement mechanisms to handle various authentication methods for protected documents
### Details:
Create an authentication module supporting multiple authentication methods (Basic, OAuth, form-based, cookie-based) with secure credential storage, session management, and re-authentication logic. Design it to integrate with the browser component and provide authentication status feedback.

## 7. Robots.txt Compliance Checker [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Develop a component to check and enforce robots.txt rules before downloading
### Details:
Implement a robots.txt parser and compliance checker that can fetch, parse, and interpret robots.txt files, check if downloads are allowed for the user agent, handle crawl delays, and provide clear compliance status. Include caching of robots.txt content to minimize requests.

## 8. File Organization System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4, 3.5
### Description: Create a system to organize and manage downloaded documents
### Details:
Build a file organization component that handles naming conventions, directory structure, duplicate detection, metadata storage, and indexing of downloaded documents. Include functionality for tagging, categorizing, and searching downloaded content.

## 9. Error Handling Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
### Details:
Develop an error handling framework that can detect, log, and respond to various error types (network issues, authentication failures, malformed content, etc.), implement retry logic with backoff strategies, provide detailed error reporting, and support graceful degradation when components fail.
