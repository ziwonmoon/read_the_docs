# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Document Reading and Query Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create functionality to read documents and process queries using LLAMAINDEX
# Details:
1. Implement document loading from preprocessed data
2. Create query processing functions using LLAMAINDEX
3. Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) methodology
4. Add relevance scoring for retrieved content
5. Implement context window management
6. Create response formatting for AI consumption
7. Add caching mechanisms for frequent queries
8. Implement error handling for missing or corrupted documents

# Test Strategy:
1. Test document loading performance
2. Verify query processing accuracy
3. Test RAG implementation with various queries
4. Validate relevance scoring
5. Test context window management
6. Verify response formatting
7. Measure query performance with and without caching

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement data loading mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a module to efficiently load preprocessed data from storage into memory for query processing
### Details:
Develop functions to load vector embeddings, document metadata, and index structures. Include support for different data formats (JSON, pickle, etc.) and implement lazy loading for large datasets to minimize memory usage. Add validation to ensure data integrity.

## 2. Develop query processing pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build a pipeline to process and transform user queries for effective retrieval
### Details:
Implement query preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal), query expansion techniques, and query type classification. Create a modular design that allows for different processing strategies based on query characteristics.

## 3. Implement RAG methodology [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create the core Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that combines retrieval with generative capabilities
### Details:
Develop vector similarity search functionality, integrate with language model APIs, and implement prompt engineering techniques. Balance retrieval quality with response generation to ensure accurate and contextually relevant answers.

## 4. Build relevance scoring system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Develop algorithms to score and rank retrieved documents based on relevance to the query
### Details:
Implement multiple scoring methods (BM25, semantic similarity, hybrid approaches) and create a ranking system that considers multiple factors. Add threshold filtering to exclude irrelevant results and develop evaluation metrics to assess relevance quality.

## 5. Create context management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Design a system to manage context window limitations and optimize context selection for the language model
### Details:
Implement context truncation, prioritization of relevant passages, and dynamic context sizing based on query complexity. Add support for maintaining conversation history in multi-turn interactions while respecting token limits.

## 6. Develop response formatting module [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.5
### Description: Create a module to format and structure responses for consistency and readability
### Details:
Implement templates for different response types, citation formatting for source attribution, and support for various output formats (text, markdown, HTML). Include options for controlling response length and detail level based on user preferences.

## 7. Implement caching system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Build a caching mechanism to improve performance for repeated or similar queries
### Details:
Develop multi-level caching (query results, embeddings, retrieved documents), implement cache invalidation strategies, and add cache hit/miss metrics. Optimize for memory efficiency while maintaining performance benefits.

## 8. Create comprehensive error handling system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7
### Description: Implement robust error handling throughout the reading and query module
### Details:
Develop graceful failure modes for each component, implement detailed logging for debugging, and create user-friendly error messages. Add automatic recovery mechanisms where possible and ensure the system degrades gracefully when components fail.
