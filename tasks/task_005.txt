# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Document Deletion Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to delete stored documents and their preprocessed data
# Details:
1. Implement file system operations for document deletion
2. Create functions to delete original documents
3. Implement deletion of preprocessed data and indices
4. Add validation to prevent accidental deletion
5. Implement logging for deletion operations
6. Create cleanup functions for partial deletions
7. Add error handling for file system operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test deletion of various document types
2. Verify complete removal of preprocessed data
3. Test validation mechanisms
4. Validate logging functionality
5. Test error handling with edge cases
6. Verify system state after deletion operations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement file system operations for deletion [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create core functions to handle file system deletion operations safely
### Details:
Develop functions to handle file deletion operations with proper checks for file existence, permissions, and path validation. Include methods for both single file and directory deletion with appropriate safeguards.

## 2. Create original data deletion workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement the process for safely deleting original data files
### Details:
Build a workflow that identifies original data files, confirms they can be safely removed, handles deletion, and verifies successful removal. Include confirmation mechanisms before permanent deletion.

## 3. Develop preprocessed data removal functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create functions to clean up preprocessed and intermediate data
### Details:
Implement functionality to identify and remove all preprocessed data, cached results, and intermediate files associated with deleted originals. Ensure database references are also cleaned up.

## 4. Add validation and safety checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive validation to prevent accidental data loss
### Details:
Create validation mechanisms that verify deletion targets, check for dependencies, confirm user intent, and prevent critical system files from being removed. Include safeguards against cascade deletions that could cause data integrity issues.

## 5. Implement comprehensive logging system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create detailed logging for all deletion operations
### Details:
Develop a logging system that records all deletion attempts, successes, and failures with timestamps, file details, user information, and operation results. Ensure logs are stored securely and can be used for auditing or recovery purposes.

## 6. Create cleanup and maintenance functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Implement scheduled and on-demand cleanup operations
### Details:
Develop functions for scheduled cleanup of temporary files, orphaned data, and system maintenance. Include options for manual triggering of cleanup operations and configurable retention policies.

## 7. Implement error handling and recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Create robust error handling for deletion operations
### Details:
Develop comprehensive error handling that catches and appropriately responds to various failure scenarios during deletion. Implement recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations and provide clear error messages to users. Include options for rollback when possible.
