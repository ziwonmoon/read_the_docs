# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement MCP SDK Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate MCP SDK to enable communication between the AI and the MCP server
# Details:
1. Import MCP SDK library
2. Configure SDK connection parameters
3. Implement message handling for AI requests
4. Create response formatters for sending data back to AI
5. Implement error handling and logging
6. Setup authentication if required
7. Create a communication protocol for document operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test connection establishment with AI
2. Verify message reception from AI
3. Validate response formatting and delivery
4. Test error handling scenarios
5. Perform end-to-end communication tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Import and initialize MCP SDK [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add the MCP SDK to the project dependencies and initialize it in the application
### Details:
Import the MCP SDK package into the project, add necessary dependencies to the build configuration, and create an initialization module that loads the SDK at application startup

## 2. Configure connection parameters [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up the configuration for connecting to the MCP service
### Details:
Create a configuration module that defines connection parameters including endpoints, timeouts, retry policies, and environment-specific settings. Implement configuration loading from environment variables or config files

## 3. Implement message handling system [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create the core message processing pipeline for MCP communication
### Details:
Develop message handlers for different message types, implement message queuing, and create the event-driven architecture to process incoming and outgoing messages. Include message validation and transformation logic

## 4. Create response formatters [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Develop formatters to standardize responses from the MCP SDK
### Details:
Implement response formatting utilities that convert raw MCP responses into application-specific formats. Create adapters for different data types and implement serialization/deserialization logic

## 5. Add error handling and logging [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for the MCP integration
### Details:
Create error handling strategies for different failure scenarios, implement retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and fallback options. Set up structured logging with appropriate log levels for monitoring and debugging

## 6. Set up authentication system [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement the authentication mechanism required by the MCP service
### Details:
Develop authentication modules that handle token generation, credential management, and session maintenance. Implement secure storage for credentials and token refresh mechanisms

## 7. Define communication protocol [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.6
### Description: Establish the protocol for interaction between the application and MCP service
### Details:
Document and implement the communication protocol including message formats, endpoints, request/response patterns, and state management. Create protocol versioning strategy and compatibility layers if needed
