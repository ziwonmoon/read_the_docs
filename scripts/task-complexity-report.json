      "taskTitle": "Setup Docker Environment",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Docker environment setup into subtasks such as creating the Dockerfile, installing dependencies, configuring environment variables, setting up volume mounts, configuring network, writing docker-compose.yml, and documenting the setup.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple configuration steps, integration of dependencies, and documentation. Each step is distinct and can be error-prone, but the overall logic is straightforward and well-bounded."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement MCP SDK Integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the MCP SDK integration into subtasks for importing the SDK, configuring connection parameters, implementing message handling, creating response formatters, adding error handling and logging, setting up authentication, and defining the communication protocol.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating an SDK with custom message handling, error management, and protocol design introduces moderate complexity, especially with authentication and robust communication requirements."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Document Download Module with Playwright",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 9,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the document download module into subtasks for browser initialization, URL validation, document type detection, PDF download, HTML scraping, authentication handling, robots.txt checking, file organization, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This module requires handling multiple document types, web crawling, authentication, compliance checks, and robust error handling, making it one of the more complex tasks."
    },

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Document Preprocessing with LLAMAINDEX",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down document preprocessing into subtasks for importing the library, loading documents, extracting text, implementing chunking, generating embeddings, creating indices, storing processed data, and adding configuration options.",
      "reasoning": "Preprocessing involves several data transformation steps, integration with a specialized library, and performance considerations, all of which add to the complexity."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Document Deletion Module",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the deletion module into subtasks for file system operations, deleting originals, removing preprocessed data, adding validation, implementing logging, creating cleanup functions, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "While deletion logic is conceptually simple, ensuring safe, complete, and recoverable deletion across multiple data types and states increases the complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Document Reading and Query Module",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the reading and query module into subtasks for loading preprocessed data, implementing query processing, RAG methodology, relevance scoring, context management, response formatting, caching, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines advanced retrieval, AI integration, performance optimization, and error management, making it highly complex."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Main Application Flow",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the main application flow into subtasks for creating the entry point, message routing, document download workflow, deletion workflow, reading/query workflow, error handling, logging, and startup/shutdown procedures.",
      "reasoning": "This is the orchestration layer, integrating all modules and workflows, requiring robust error handling, coordination, and system-wide logic, making it the most complex task."
    },

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Configuration and Environment Management",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand configuration management into subtasks for creating file structure, handling environment variables, validation, default configs, reloading, documentation, and environment-specific settings.",
      "reasoning": "Configuration management is essential for maintainability and flexibility, involving several discrete but interrelated steps."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Logging and Monitoring",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down logging and monitoring into subtasks for setting up the framework, implementing log levels, log rotation, performance metrics, health checks, error reporting, and audit logging.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive logging and monitoring require integration of multiple concerns (performance, security, reliability) and careful design."
    },
